== 1.7.2

  Release Notes:

  RightAws includes some new features, including:
  - Support in RightAws::S3 and RightAws::S3Interface for S3 key copy, move, and rename

    We now reset the seek pointer of the streaming IO object to its initial position.
  - Removal of an accidental dependency on ActiveSupport in RightAws::S3Interface.get_link().
  - Monkey-patch of the Ruby File class on Windows platforms to correct a problem in lstat.

== 1.8.0

  Release Notes:

  This release adds major new features to RightAws to support Amazon's new
  Elastic Block Store (EBS).  Via the RightAws::Ec2 module, users can create
  and delete EBS volumes, attach and detach them from instances, snapshot
  volumes, and list the available volumes and snapshots.

  Bug fixes include correction of RightAws::S3 copy's failure to url-encode
the source key.

    result sorting and attributes auto loading

    representing Ruby nil in SDB.
